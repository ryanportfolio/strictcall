# Harness Firmware

[![validate-template](https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware/actions/workflows/validate-template.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware/actions/workflows/validate-template.yml)

A portable operating layer for AI coding agents: standing rules, on-demand
skills, committed memory, session hooks, and sync scripts. Claude Code gets the
full system. Codex gets a safe boundary in `AGENTS.md` and the same playbooks.
It compounds: when work hits a gotcha, one command saves the lesson as
committed project memory, and every later session starts with it loaded.

## 60-second quickstart

### skills only (start here)

Adds the skill set to a project you already have. Nothing else changes.

```text
/plugin marketplace add ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware
/plugin install claude-starter@claude-starter
```

Plugin skills are namespaced, for example `/claude-starter:recall`. The plugin
id stays `claude-starter` so existing installs keep working. This path needs the
repository to be public.

### full template

Use this when you want the whole system: kernel, hooks, memory, skills, and
starter sync. Projects spawned this way get the skills without the namespace.

- GitHub UI: **Use this template -> Create a new repository**, clone it, open it
  in Claude Code, then run `/init-project`.
- macOS / Linux: `bash bootstrap/new-claude-project.sh --name my-app --dest ~/code`
- Windows one-click: double-click `bootstrap/New-ClaudeProject.cmd`.
- Windows CLI: `.\bootstrap\new-claude-project.ps1 -Name my-app -Dest C:\code`
- Windows visual launcher: download and extract
  [`New-ClaudeProject-UI.zip`](https://github.com/ryanportfolio/Harness-Firmware/releases/latest/download/New-ClaudeProject-UI.zip),
  then double-click `New-ClaudeProject-UI.cmd`. Keep the extracted launcher,
  PowerShell module, and `template/` folder together; the bundled snapshot makes
  local-only creation work without GitHub access.

`/init-project` detects the stack, asks a short Q&A, fills the verification and
deploy sections, seeds reference files, prunes irrelevant skills, removes
spawn-only template files, and commits the setup. Two of its questions matter
early:

- **prose mode.** Default is terse `caveman ultra`, inherited from the template.
  Pick `normal` at the prompt for ordinary prose. See
  [prose mode](#prose-mode) to change it later.
- **skill preset.** `full` ships everything. `minimal` keeps the core loop and
  the discipline skills and drops the extras.

### Codex

1. Open the repo in Codex.
2. Let Codex read `AGENTS.md` as the authoritative Codex instruction boundary.
3. Use `.claude/reference/` for shared project memory.
4. Let Codex discover the generated repo skills under `.agents/skills/`.
5. Do not run Claude hooks or inherit Claude auto-commit/auto-merge rules unless
   the user explicitly asks in the current Codex session.

For a fresh project, ask Codex to initialize the starter or select the
`init-project` skill. Its adapter delegates to the same workflow Claude Code
uses.

## prose mode

The template answers in terse `caveman ultra` by default: replies drop articles
and filler, code and error strings stay word for word, and security warnings and
irreversible-action confirmations drop back to plain prose automatically.

Two files assert it, and they must agree:

- `CLAUDE.md`, the `## Default prose mode: caveman ultra` section.
- `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, three blocks marked
  `# >>> caveman:directive:begin` / `caveman:reminder` / `caveman:call`.

To change it:

- **At setup:** answer `normal`, or `lite` / `full` / `ultra`, when
  `/init-project` asks. It edits both files for you.
- **Later, softer level:** replace `ultra` with `lite` or `full` in both files.
  The intensity table in `.claude/skills/caveman/SKILL.md` describes each.
- **Later, off entirely:** delete that `CLAUDE.md` section and the three marked
  hook blocks, marker comments included. The `caveman` skill stays installed, so
  `/caveman` still works on demand; it just isn't the default.
- **For one session only:** say "stop caveman" or "normal mode".

Check the two files agree afterward:

```bash
grep -rn caveman CLAUDE.md .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
```

Either nothing comes back, or the same level everywhere.

## check your install

```bash
node .claude/scripts/doctor.mjs
```

It reports whether hooks are wired, skills parse, Codex adapters are in sync,
and any `FILL IN` markers survived `/init-project`.

## what the always-loaded layer costs

Measured on this template with `bash .claude/scripts/context-weight.sh`:

| Always-loaded piece | Per turn |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` kernel (5.5 KB) | ~1,400 tokens |
| 20 skill descriptions in the available-skills list | ~800 tokens |
| **Total (file-measurable)** | **~2,200 tokens** |

`doctor.mjs` reports the same measure over repo files only; `context-weight.sh`
also counts your machine-global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. MCP tool lists,
marketplace skill descriptions, and per-machine auto-memory are not measured by
either; check those in session. Run it in your own project before deciding a
rule deserves the kernel. The `minimal` preset drops the extras tier, cutting
the skill description line item by about half.

## why this exists

Everything you put in the prompt makes every turn heavier. Everything you leave
out, a project relearns the hard way. And Claude-specific automation that leaks
into Codex turns useful defaults into unsafe commands.

So the work is split: the kernel stays small and always loaded, skills hold the
long playbooks until a task calls for them, reference files keep project memory
out of the transcript, hooks handle cheap startup checks, and sync scripts move
reusable improvements between projects.

This matches emerging practice for skill libraries. Only the short
descriptions load every turn; the full playbook loads when a skill is invoked.
Each description says when to reach for the skill, which is what routes
requests to it. Every skill carries a recorded origin, a periodic usage audit,
and a measured context cost.

## work loop

The loop is the point. An agent with no durable memory relearns the same
gotcha in every session; here you write it down once and it stays fixed. Each
lesson gets a named home (`.claude/reference/` for project facts, the
`CLAUDE.md` kernel for cross-cutting rules), travels with the repo, and is
loaded before the work that needs it. Use the template while you work, then
feed the useful parts back into it:

- `/recall save <text>` records a project gotcha in the right reference file.
- `/sync-starter` moves a generic improvement back to the template, so every
  future project starts with it, or pulls a template improvement into a
  spawned project.
- `bash .claude/scripts/context-weight.sh` shows what the always-loaded layer
  costs per turn.
- `/optimize-context` is the playbook for cutting context that no longer earns
  its place.

The last two keep the loop honest: every saved rule costs tokens on every
turn, so lessons that stop earning their place get pruned instead of piling
up.

## runtime boundary

| Runtime | Entry point | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/` | The full template: kernel rules, slash skills, project memory, session hook, plugin path, and Claude-specific workflow rules. |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/` | A safe compatibility layer plus native skill discovery, backed by the same Claude workflows, unchanged. |

Codex discovers thin adapters under `.agents/skills/`. Each adapter delegates to
the matching `.claude/skills/` workflow, so both runtimes use one source of
truth. `AGENTS.md` defines the safety boundary. Codex does not run
Claude SessionStart hooks. The template intentionally has no project Codex hook:
`AGENTS.md` already loads natively, while command hooks add a separate trust and
platform-failure surface.

## what's inside

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code kernel rules loaded every turn: verification, git workflow, subagent discipline, and context restraint. Two placeholder sections are filled per project by `/init-project`. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex boundary. Inherits project facts without inheriting Claude-only hooks or automatic git behavior. |
| `.claude/skills/` | The Markdown playbooks themselves, used by Claude Code and Codex. |
| `.agents/skills/` | Generated Codex-native adapters; metadata only, no duplicated workflow bodies. |
| `.claude/reference/` | Durable project memory: secrets, architecture, pitfalls, commands, tech stack, and deployment notes. |
| `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` | Claude Code SessionStart hook for drift checks, overlap warnings, and Claude-specific defaults. |
| `.claude/scripts/context-weight.sh` | Prints always-loaded context weight, including a per-skill breakdown. |
| `.claude/scripts/doctor.mjs` | Install health check: hooks, skills, adapter sync, leftover markers. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code hook wiring plus a Bash permission allowlist. |
| `.claude-plugin/` | Claude plugin and marketplace manifests. Template-only for spawned projects. |
| `bootstrap/` | Project creation, fork retargeting, and machine setup scripts. |

## skill set

Three tiers. The `minimal` preset in `/init-project` keeps the first two and
drops the extras listed below.

- **Core loop** (project lifecycle and shipping): `init-project`, `recall`,
  `sync-starter`, `optimize-context`, `addskill`, `merge`.
- **Discipline** (how work gets done): `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`,
  `impartial-review`, `writing-skills`.
- **Extras** (situational): `advocate`, `caveman`, `enhance-prompt`,
  `fable-mode`, `forge-repo-ui-skill`, `handoff-audit`, `humanizer`, `lab`,
  `purposeful-writing`, `why`.

`.claude/skills/PROVENANCE.md` records where the forked skills came from, their
licenses, and what changed here. Together the tiers, the provenance file, and
the `doctor.mjs` audits act as library governance: every skill has a known
origin, an intent-based description, and a periodic reason to keep existing.

## safety model

This template is supposed to travel, so defaults must stay safe outside one
person's machine.

- Runtime-specific rules stay runtime-specific. Claude hooks and Claude popup
  constraints do not become Codex standing orders.
- Template files must not ship private checkout paths, maintainer-only workflow
  mandates, secrets, tokens, or local-machine assumptions.
- Git automation stages explicit paths and protects against direct pushes to
  `main`, force-pushes, secret files, and unverified completion claims.
- Installs, migrations, deploys, deletes, branch merges, and edits outside the
  current workspace require explicit user authority for the current session.
- Verification claims must name the check that actually ran. If the real signal
  is CI, deploy logs, or the user's machine, say that instead of pretending.

## forking this template

One command retargets functional upstream references to your fork:

```bash
bash bootstrap/retarget-fork.sh <you>/<your-fork>
```

Review the diff and commit. LICENSE attribution is intentionally left untouched.

## dotfiles for Claude

Machine-level `~/.claude` files do not travel with any repo. Keep your copies in
`bootstrap/machine/home-claude/` in your fork, then on a new machine run:

```powershell
.\bootstrap\setup-machine.ps1
```

The script copies missing files only. `-Force` overwrites. `-DryRun` previews.

## requirements

- Claude Code for the full template and plugin workflow.
- Codex uses `AGENTS.md` and native `.agents/skills/` adapters. It does not run
  Claude SessionStart hooks or need a project hook to load repository guidance.
- Node for `doctor.mjs` and the Codex adapter sync script.
- `gh` CLI is optional for the project creators. Without it,
  `new-claude-project.sh` still clones the template over the network; only the
  Windows launcher's bundled snapshot (and `-LocalOnly`) works with no GitHub
  access.
- Bootstrap ships PowerShell for Windows and a POSIX script for macOS and Linux.
  The Claude session hook is Bash and is validated under Ubuntu CI.

## contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the change process, what belongs in the kernel versus
a skill, and how to run validation before opening a PR. Bug reports and skill
proposals have templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Released changes are
listed in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## provenance and license

MIT. See `LICENSE`.

Several skills are forked from upstream work, notably Jesse Vincent's
`superpowers` skills (MIT). `.claude/skills/PROVENANCE.md` tracks forked origins,
licenses, and local changes. Per-skill LICENSE and NOTICE files ship in
third-party skill folders when required.
